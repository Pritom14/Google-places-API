# Google-places-API

Google places API demo app for android which lists surrounding Restaurants, Malls, ATM etc..

#### Setup
1. Register for Google Places API Access key. Follow the steps [here] (https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/). And get one yourself.
2. Since I'm using Map in this app, get Access key for Maps as well. Here is the [documentation] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/).

Add your Google places Access key in MainActivity.java, and also update location values.
